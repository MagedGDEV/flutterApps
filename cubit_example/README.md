# Cubit

This is part **ONE** of a series of tutorials that will be used to demonstrate how to use the ***[flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)*** & ***[bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc)*** packages to manage the state of a Flutter application.

First we will start with a simple application that lets the user pick a random name from a stored list of names.

It will demonstrate the following concepts:

- How to create a **cubit** to manage the state of the application using the ***flutter_bloc*** & ***bloc*** packages.
- How to add **extension** to a class.
